# Kaizen Stories

Stories are important to share. This is a place to share experiences of [kaizen](http://www.kaizen.com/about-us/definition-of-kaizen.html) in your organization. Please read the how to submit stories section if you want to participate. 

# Why does this exist?
Change is really hard. There are tons of books written on all the ways you should be able to improve how an organization works, but there are no one size fits all solutions. For most organizations change occurs over time & requires passionate individuals to listen, learn, and be persistent. We want to hear your experiences, share ours, and support each other in the journey.

We believe that culture matters a lot, and that the stories of how we move through this process of improvement can help others. In a discussion in #culture on hangops.slack.com we wanted to experiment with a way for individuals to share stories, get feedback in an AMA (Ask Me Anything) style.
